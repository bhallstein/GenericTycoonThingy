<!--This is a sample Settings file for DBT in XML format

  -settings are categorised for ease of editing and for grouping in menus
  -settings are typecast for validation purposes and for display (ui type) in menus

  ATTRIBUTES:
  -the presence of the "arg" attribute means the setting can be overridden in the command line
  -the presence of the "detect" attribute tells the game it needs to perform a test and update the settings
    e.g. checking for available resolutions and adding them as <option>s to the <combo> for Resolution
    otherwise the game uses only the values in the settings file, unless an error occurs, in which case it
    will run the relevant test or revert to a safe default in order to recover
  -the presence of the "dev" attribute indicates a developer setting; this should not be shown as an option in game
    so the player cannot change it, but it is still a setting, and can be changed in the settings file or the dev console
    for development/testing purposes
    -there is also a <dev> section where settings can be declared without the dev attribute and still be hidden.
      the dev attribute just means if a settings SHOULD be in a certain section for organisation, it can be and yet still
      be hidden :)

  TYPES:
  -bools require no 2nd parameter in the command line and take a value of 0 or 1, display as a check box
  -ints take a 2nd parameter that must be numeric, display as a number spinner, or a slider?
  -strings take a 2nd parameter, display as a text box?
  -combos take a 2nd parameter that is validated against the options listed, display as a combo box of the options

  -optionally could use an attribute to specify display options of a type - e.g. spinner vs slider for int, or
    drop-down vs listbox for combo? but they default to one if the attribute isn't there. Of course this stuff is for GUI so don't need it yet-->
