/*
 * GameState.hpp - base class for creating State objects
 *
 * Note on pseudo-singletons:
 *  - For classes you want to ensure have only one instance, can prevent this from happening by providing a static `instances` property.
 *  - Then, in the constructor of your class, if (instances > 0), you can throw an exception.
 *		- Remember to initialise the static immediately after your class interface: `MyState::instances = 0;`
 *      - The static must be in the derived class, because otherwise all derived classes will share the base classâ€™s static.
 *      - Also, it is good practice to always refer to your static as Class::property, since it makes the staticity clear to the reader.
 *      - See ben.am/eK
